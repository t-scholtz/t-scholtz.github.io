Profile
======
Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering focusing on **computer architecture and embedded systems**.  
My research sits at the intersection of **low-level systems and hardware–software co-design**, with a particular interest in **domain-specific architectures**. I work on tools for designing **application-specific, bespoke processors**.

Education
======
* **Ph.D. in Computer Engineering**, Virginia Tech, 2025–Present  
  * Research Area: Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems

* **B.S. in Computer Engineering**, University at Buffalo, 2021–2025  
  * GPA: 3.88  
  * Honors: Summa Cum Laude, Honors College Graduate

Research & Professional Experience
======
* **Graduate Research Assistant**, FoRTE Lab, Virginia Tech  
  * *Supervisor:* Prof. Matthew Hicks  
  * *Dates:* June 2025 – Present  
  * Research Area: Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems  
  * Developed a hardware-agnostic tool for generating application-specific, bespoke processors, enabling greater flexibility and improved performance compared to existing methodologies.  
  * Evaluated current approaches to bespoke processor design, analyzing trade-offs in performance, effectiveness, and design complexity.

* **Research Intern**, Center for Computational Research  
  * *Supervisor:* Dr. Joseph White  
  * *Dates:* May 2024 – August 2024  
  * *Project:* Augmenting a Developmental Virtual Assistant  
  * Built a data pipeline to generate, clean, and embed structured information for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database, achieving over 90% answer accuracy for an internal AI support chatbot.  
  * Conducted embedding and query experiments to optimize data formats and retrieval performance.  
  * Extended the XDMoD web portal with features such as Python code generation for chart replication and deep linking to usage views.

* **Research Assistant**, School of Engineering, University at Buffalo  
  * *Principal Investigator:* Prof. Wenyao Xu  
  * *Dates:* April 2023 – August 2023  
  * *Project:* Automated Speech Recording and Analysis Tool  
  * Integrated multiple speech-to-text tools into a unified system, developing a custom sentence-combination algorithm to improve transcription accuracy.  
  * Conducted comparative evaluations across state-of-the-art tools and custom models, reducing Word Error Rate by 5%.  
  * Led weekly team meetings and presented project outcomes to the department.

* **Research Assistant**, School of Computer Science, University at Buffalo  
  * *Principal Investigator:* Dr. Weihang Wang  
  * *Dates:* December 2021 – August 2022  
  * *Project:* Automated Detection of Compilation Differences Between Compilers  
  * Designed and implemented a differential software testing framework to detect behavioral discrepancies between compilers.  
  * Built automated testing tools for C and WebAssembly, identifying inconsistencies in approximately 7% of tested programs.  
  * Categorized failures into fault types for systematic analysis.

* **Intern**, Gravatronics  
  * *Location:* Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa  
  * *Dates:* January 2021 – April 2021  
  * Assisted in the construction and testing of Battery Management System (BMS) prototypes.  
  * Developed automation scripts to convert circuit design files for pick-and-place manufacturing.  
  * Gained hands-on experience in circuit design, prototyping, and hardware testing.

## Who I am?
Well, isn't that a near cripiling phycological quesiton? Who I am? Who is anyone, for that matter?

I am a Computer Engineering major studying at the University at Buffalo. I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2002. I adore technology, both how it works, and how it is able to solve problems in the real world. I also like unicode art \ (•◡•) /


## Hobbies and intrests 
I love reading, music, hiking, and films.

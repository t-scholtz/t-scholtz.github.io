## A review of my summer research experince

During my summer break, I had the incredible opportunity to work under the guidance of Prof. Xu and receive mentorship from Grad student Wei Bo. Together with an amazing team of fellow undergraduates, we work on researching the potential of creating a speech disorder diagnosis tool.

The group was split into three seperate teams being STT(speech to text), MDD(Mis-pronuncaiont detection and diagnosis), and NSSD(Non-speech sound detection). I work by myselft on the STT section. Its [population peaked][census] in the 1950s

One of the highlights of this summer was being chosen from our team to present our work at a prestigious REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) symposium. It was an honor to showcase our findings and interact with professionals and fellow researchers in the field. You can watch the presentation of our work here, where we discuss our research objectives, methodologies, and promising results.

The research process itself was both intriguing and rewarding. We meticulously analyzed speech data, applied cutting-edge technologies, and honed our analytical skills to interpret the results. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into the world of research and its potential impact on improving the lives of individuals with speech disorders.

Reflecting on this summer, I am grateful for the guidance of Prof. Xu and the mentorship of Wei Bo, who played pivotal roles in nurturing our passion for research. They encouraged us to explore beyond the confines of textbooks and classroom learning, and instead, embrace real-world challenges with curiosity and tenacity.

If you're considering an opportunity like this, I wholeheartedly recommend it. Engaging in research provides a unique blend of personal growth and academic learning. The hands-on experience, coupled with the chance to contribute to the advancement of knowledge, is truly fulfilling.

As the summer comes to an end, I am excited to carry forward the lessons and skills gained from this experience into my academic journey. This summer has ignited a passion for research within me, and I eagerly look forward to future opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects.

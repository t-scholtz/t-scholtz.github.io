## A simple review of UB from a Comp Eng's perspective

What is Buffalo like?

To the uninitiated, Buffalo may conjure images of a desolate wasteland, where frost and cold reign, accompanied by merciless winds that strip the flesh from your bones. Whilst that isn't exactly wrong, there is a bit more to it.

While Buffalo's glory days are long gone, it was once a thriving metropolitan city. Its [population peaked][census] in the 1950s, but it has been on a decline ever since. Buffalo's river access and affordable power generation contributed to its status as a [manufacturing centre][man] and its significant growth. However, as transportation routes shifted and manufacturing moved elsewhere, Buffalo's influence waned. The city has struggled to transition to a post-industrial economy, yet it persists.

So, what can you do in Buffalo? Interestingly enough, the website '[Buffalo.org][buff]' seems to have an answer to that question.

That pretty much sums it up. You can always entertain yourself with the infamous phrase "Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo" for hours of fun.

‘The University at Buffalo’ was founded in [1846][ub], eemingly defying the very concept of rational thought. Nonetheless, UB boasts the distinction of being the third greenest campus in the US([in terms of power being generated vs used][green]). A remarkable feat considering that the majority of electricity usage is dedicated to combating the relentless and ever-present cold.

UUB fosters an active social student life, although the physical separation of the North campus from the city can make attending social events a bit of a challenge. Nevertheless, students find ways to overcome this obstacle, perhaps in the pursuit of creating more difficulties for others.

In all honesty, UB is an excellent institution with competent and knowledgeable professors who excel at teaching (at least in the engineering department, I can't speak for others).

To conclude, here's a snapshot of the typical weather in Buffalo during July. Enjoy!

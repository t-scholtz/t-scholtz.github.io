## A simple review of UB from a Comp Eng's perspective



What is Buffalo like?

To the uninitiated. Imagine a desolate wasteland, borne from frost and cold, with winds that tear the flesh from your bones. Well, 25 miles south of there, is where one finds Buffalo. Good old, charming Buffalo.

Whilst by all accounts, Buffalo is way past its hay day. Buffalo used to be one of the top metropolitan US cities. It hit [peak population][census] in the 1950s and has been declining ever since. It used to hold substantial influence due to its river access, and cheap power generation. These traits allowed it to become a [manufacturing centre][man] and, and grow to a substantial size. However, over time, Buffalo’s geographic position was no longer essential to the preferred path of shipments and transportation. And as manufacturing moved to other parts of the world, Buffalo lost influence. Buffalo has struggled to create a post-industrial economy and has been declining since. Yet, it's still kicking.

So, what is there to do in Buffalo? Well, charmingly enough, ‘[Buffalo.org][buff]’ seems to offer an answer to such a question.

I can confidently say, that that sums it up rather adequately.
I suppose you can always entertain yourself with the old adage “Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo”
hours of fun.

‘The University at Buffalo’ was founded in [1846][ub], presumably in sheer spite of the concept of rational thought. Anyways, UB is actually the 3rd greenest campus in the US([in terms of power being generated vs used][green]). Which is quite impressive when you consider that approximately, 99.999% of all electricity being used, is used to battle the fearsome and ever-ready cold.

UB has an active social student life. Although, North campus is somewhat physically separated from the city, which can make getting to social events a pain. However, students regularly get around this difficulty, in the name of making more difficulties for others.

In all honesty, UB is a really good school. It has competent, knowledgeable professors, who know how to teach( or at least the engineering department does, I can’t vouch for anything else ).

In conclusion, here is a picture of the average Buffalo weather in July :)

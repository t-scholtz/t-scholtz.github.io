## First Post

The intention of this webpage, and thereby this blog post, is to be able to attach it to a CV. With the current( at time of writing ) being to apply for a summer intership. Being an international student, I don't know how that will work exactly, but I belive!

I probally don' need to have a webpage, but at the same time, I think it is somewhat expceted in any CS related field. I guess it shows base line compentance. Ah yes, we see you are able to use github and follow an online tutorial, that is the skill set we are looking for :).

Welp, hopefull this endeavor succeds and does not end in flames. If you are a future recuiter of sorts, ( *・∀・)ノ゛ , I hope you are having a good, and do not consider this too childish.

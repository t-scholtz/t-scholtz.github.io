This is a speech I gave at one of the English club's open mic's. I don't know how well this will translate from speech to a blog post, but I thought it might be worth sharing. Enjoy if you cant.

Hear ye hear ye.

Today, we come together, both for the obvious reason of this event and, if you will, to mourn the loss of something deeply cherished. Loss, an inevitable part of life, sees dreams fade away, trends disappear, and the occasional family member depart from this world, as they are wont to do. But today, we gather in remembrance of words that have gone extinct. Dead. Gone. Stripped from dictionaries, faded from encyclopedias, and... [makes a sweeping hand motion] erased from thesauruses. It is a profound and grievous loss that has required a team of dedicated researchers to even notice. Truly, a tragedy in its own right.

However, let me clarify. When I proclaim a word as dead, I simply mean that it once existed and has now faded away. I know, gasp. Yet, if we contemplate it, a word is nothing more than a collection of arbitrary sounds to which we assign meaning—thoughts or objects. The crucial aspect that distinguishes a word from a mere assortment of sounds is that another person can recognize and comprehend its significance. But memories are fallible, and what was once known may be forgotten over time, lost in the annals of history. What about the words that were once part of everyday language but are now unrecognized?

The demise of words can be attributed to three forms: transformation, archival, and oblivion. Nowadays, old and unused words find themselves archived in databases, typically marked as archaic or "out of fashion." Some recent additions to this archive include sternforemost, aerodrome, and frutescent. In the past, and to a lesser extent even today, words tend to undergo transformation as languages evolve and develop. As one language emerges from another, words adapt to fit the new linguistic landscape. Yet, there are occasions when words vanish completely, disappearing from the face of the Earth. If the last person who remembered a word passes away without leaving any written record, that word is gone forever.

Nevertheless, there exist sanctuaries for words, keeping them, if not exactly alive, then perhaps undead. Take the Bible, for example, which is filled with words and phrases whose meanings, at this point, are known solely in relation to the biblical context. "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" is an ancient hymn dating back to 1739. Upon hearing this, you might assume that "Hark" is a name, like Jim the baker or John the blacksmith, with the title of "herald." However, "hark" is an archaic word meaning "listen intensely" or "hear." You won't find a professor telling you to "hark" during the next lecture, although I must admit, I wouldn't put it past the English department. Stem professors, on the other hand, wouldn't employ such a term. If you listen carefully, you can almost hear Shakespeare in his grave, not giving a damn.

Yet, it's not just the ancient, moth-ridden words from the depths of your grandmother's closet that face extinction. No, even modern slang arrives and departs swiftly. Crunk, owled, and grindage have all met their demise. And you can expect yeet, bagman, and sus to follow suit in due course.

Ultimately, language doesn't pass down through the ages as one might suspect. Each generation takes its turn, breaking, stretching, warping, tearing, but ultimately rebuilding language from the ground up. We dust off the old while polishing the new, discarding the outdated jargon, clichés, and even beloved terms, making room for something fresh and invaluable. And in all honesty, it's for the better, methinks. Will anyone truly miss words like "whom," "noon," or "dove" (the past tense of "dive," not the bird) as they march toward extinction?

In conclusion, I ask for but a moment of silence—a tribute to the ghastly treated and, if fate allows, swift demise of the word "Fortnight."

Thank you, thank you all.

This is a speech I gave at one of the English club's open mic's. I don't know how well this will translate from speech to a blog post, but I thought it might be worth sharing. Enjoy if you cant.

Hear thy hear thy. 

We are gathered here today, (for the obvious reason of the event, but also if you will), to mourn the loss of something deeply valued. Loss is an intrinsic part of life. Dreams are let go, trends fade away, and the odd family member kicks the bucket, as they are want to do. But today we are gathered in remembrance of the words that hath gone extinct. Dead. Gone. Removed from dictionaries, faded from encyclopedias, and … and… [makes away hand motion] from thesauruses. A deep and great loss to us all. So great in fact, that it required a team of dedicated researchers, with too much time on their hands, to notice. Such a tragedy.

Now, the death of words can be said to take three forms: transformation, archival, and forgotten. Nowadays, old unused words generally get archived in some database, usually being flagged as archaic, or 'out of fashion '. Recent words that have been deemed for archival include: sternforemost, aerodrome, and frutescent. In the past, and to a lesser today, words tended to change form as languages evolve and change. As one language emerges from another, words tend to change to fit the new language. However, sometimes words get forgotten in their entirety. They Disappear from the face of the Earth. When the last person who remembered a word dies, if that word has not been written in some form, it is just gone.

However, there are some word sanctuaries hard at work. Keeping words, if not necessarily alive, at the very least, undead perhaps. The Bible, for example, is littered with words and phrases, whose meaning is, at this point, only known in relation to the bible. “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing” is an old hymn dating back to 1739. If you are like me, upon hearing this, you might assume Hark is a name. Whose title is that of herald. Thus Hark the herald, in the same vain as Jim the backer, or John the blacksmith. However, hark is ye olden word for hear, or listen intensely. Yet you won’t find a professor telling you to hark the next part of the lecture. Well I say that, but I wouldn’t really put it past the English department, but you wouldn’t hear a stem professor say so. If you listen very closely, you can hear Shakespeare in his grave, not giving a shit.

But it’s not just bagged, dusty old words from the back of your grandmother's closet, hidden under the lingerie, that go extinct. No, new slang tends to leave as quickly as it arrives. Crunk, owled, and grindage have all already faced the chopping block. And you can expect yeet, bagman, and sus, to face a similar fate soon enough.

Ultimately, language isn't actually passed down through the ages, as one might suspect. Each generation takes their turn; breaking, stretching, warping, tearing, but ultimately re-building it from the ground up. Dusting off the old and polishing the new. Throwing out the old cannon, jargon, baby and bath water all at once, to make way for something new and precious. And for all the better, methinks. Is anyone really going to miss words like “whom”, "noon", and "dove", which heading for extinction? 

In closing, I would ask, for but a moment of silence. For the ghastly treated, and , god willing, swift death of the word Fortnight.

Thank you

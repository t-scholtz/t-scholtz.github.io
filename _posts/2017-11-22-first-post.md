## First Post

The intention of this webpage, and thereby this blog post, is to be CV of sorts. That being said, I have linked my actual CV.  I have this with the intention of applying for summer internships. Being an international student, I don't really know how this will all work, but I trust some good will come of this.

I probably don' need to have a webpage, but at the same time, I think it is somewhat expected for CS related jobs and internships. I guess it shows base line competence and ability. 'Ah yes, we see you are able to use github, and follow an [tutorial][online tutorial], that is the skill set we are looking for!' :). Anyhow, this was fun making, and who knows, maybe I will keep up this blog section. 

Welp, hopefully this endeavor succeeds and does not end in flames. If you are a future recruiter of sorts, ( *・∀・)ノ゛ , I hope you are having a good, and do not consider this all too childish.

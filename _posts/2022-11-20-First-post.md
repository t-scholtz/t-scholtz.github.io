## First Post

The intention of this website, and thereby this blog post, is to be a CV of sorts. That being said, I have linked my actual [Link Cv]CV (for any interested parties). I created this website with the intention of applying for summer internships, but I will likely modify it as time passes to suit future needs.
 
If I am completely honest, I don't fully understand how applying for summer internships works. To be fair, I am an international student, so the whole process is somewhat foreign([ba dum tsh][ba dum]) to me.  I far as I have gathered, I need to apply like a normal US student, and then ask my university for an OPT. However, I can only submit an application once I have an offer. So that then raises the question - 'how does the normal US student acquire one summer internship?'
 
What I have gathered so far is that one should: have a superb and delectable resume, have existing and exciting side projects, and I should have started 3 months ago.
 
That being said, I probably don't need to have a webpage, but at the same time, I think it is somewhat expected for CS related jobs and internships. I guess it shows general competence and ability(to follow a [youtube tutorial][tutorial]). Anyhow, this was fun making, and who knows, maybe I will keep up this blog section.
 
Welp, hopefully this endeavour succeeds and does not end in flames. If you are a future recruiter of sorts,
 ( *・∀・)ノ゛ , I hope you are doing well, and do not consider this all too childish.

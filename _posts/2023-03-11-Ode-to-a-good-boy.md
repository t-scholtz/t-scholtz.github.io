## Ode to a Good Boy: In Loving Memory of Jack

Unfortunately, my dog, Jack, has recently passed away. His absence leaves a void that will be deeply felt. Jack, though not the bravest, possessed a sweetness and gentleness that touched our souls.

We got Jack from Ark Animal Shelter when he was just a baby. As fate would have it, he was the last of his litter to find a forever home. In a twist of irony, even his mother was adopted before him.

Jack was a Labrador crossbreed, although his Labrador lineage seemed to have been mostly crossed out. Nevertheless, he had an eternal love for food and an occasional stubborn streak that added to his unique charm.

Our memories of Jack will forever be cherished. He was a good boy.

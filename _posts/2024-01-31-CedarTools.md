## Cedar Tools

[Cedar Tools][cedar-tools] is an ongoing [project][cedar-git] of mine. The goal of the project is to develop a webiste that offers an array of simple software tools that are used during computer science/engineer endavours. 

I've built the webiste using:
- Flask
- Bulma
- CSS
And I'm running it on an nginx server using [Lets Encrypt][letsencrypt].

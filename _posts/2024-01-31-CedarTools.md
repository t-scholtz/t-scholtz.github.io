## Cedar Tools

[Cedar Tools][cedar-tools] is an ongoing [project][cedar-git] of mine. The goal of the project is to develop a webiste that offers an array of simple software tools that are used during computer science/engineer endavours. 

I've built the webiste using:
- Flask
- Bulma
- CSS
And I'm running it on an nginx server using [Lets Encrypt][letsencrypt].

Right now, I'm hosting the sever on a [droplet][https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets](a virtual machine hosted externally). These vm's are offred by DigitalOcean, which lets you pay a subsction to use a small vm which you can ssh into and setup to work as a server. This also has the added benifit that they have fixed IP address, and you don't have to worry about ISPN's or other local network settings changing your address.

My goal is for the site to have a host of tools which I can acess at anytime, anywhere, that will let me complete work faster. And I hope that others will be able to find use out of the website too!. If you have any suggetions or features you would like added, please leave a comment on the websites about page.

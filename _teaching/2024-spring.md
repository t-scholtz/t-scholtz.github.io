Lab Monitor & Teaching Assistant for [CSE 241](https://catalogs.buffalo.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=1&coid=1041), supported lab sessions and office hours.

I served as a Lab Monitor and Teaching Assistant for one semester, helping run labs focused on election logic, maintaining lab organization, and assisting students with debugging basic digital circuits. The course covers fundamental digital principles including Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential circuit design, and programming logic.

Teaching Assistant for [CSE 321](https://catalogs.buffalo.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=1&coid=1048), supported and graded embedded systems projects.

I worked as a Teaching Assistant for one semester, during which the course was taken over by a new professors. As such, most of my time was devoted to developing new project materials, including project instructions and grading rubrics. I also assisted students in designing, implementing, and debugging their own embedded system projects.

Teaching Assistant for [CSE 116](https://catalogs.buffalo.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=1&coid=1039), helped with running labs and providing support during office hours.

I worked as a Teaching Assistant for this course over several semesters. During that time, I helped with lab instruction, office hours, and testing new student projects. I also supported the transition of the course from Scala to Java, helping ensure a smooth update of assignments and materials.

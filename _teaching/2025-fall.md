Head TA for [ECE 3504](https://ece.vt.edu/undergrad/courses/3504.html), graded projects, assignments, and exams.

I served as Head TA for two semesters, designing the structure and grading tools for MIPS projects, advising students on their work, and acting as the primary grader for exams. I also ran office hours, providing support and guidance to help students succeed in the course.

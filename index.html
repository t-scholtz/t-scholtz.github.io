    &emsp;&emsp;I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and subsequently grew up there. 
    I matriculated from Red Hill High School, in Sandton, with 6 Distinctions. I am currently enrolled at 'The University at Buffalo', SUNY, and am a member of the Honours college there, with a GPA of 3.9. 
    I love reading, playing music, and the outdoors. Furthermore, I'm interested in video games, and movies( if you're looking for a recommendation, you might want to try "The Princess Bride").

## Github.io

I created this github page a personal website. Its a mix between personal project and a sort of CV(I have linked my actual [CV][https://t-scholtz.github.io/CV.pdf] for any interested parties). Its not the most technical of side projects, but it is a good reminder that real world projects are a mix of coding/implmentation, but that alot of the work ends up being documention, writing conetnet, and organising files.

This page was largely based off this [youtube tutorial][tutorial], although I have made a few modifictaions to fit my purposes/play with wahts possible.

I also redirected a url(tim-s.me) to this page, which I thought was quite fun.
